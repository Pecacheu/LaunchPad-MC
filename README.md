# LaunchPad-MC
#### Control your game with a physical device!

This is a plugin that allows you to use a [Novation LaunchPad](http://us.novationmusic.com/launch/launchpad-pro) MIDI control surface to control my [Elevators](http://dev.bukkit.org/projects/elevators-v2) plugin. Currently, it only allows you to use a LaunchPad Pro, but support for other MIDI controllers, as well as other aspects of the game, are planned.

This is really more of an experiment than anything else, but if you're a plugin developer and you have something to add, or want to add support for another plugin, feel free to send me a pull-request on [GitHub](http://github.com/Pecacheu/LaunchPad-MC/pulls)!
