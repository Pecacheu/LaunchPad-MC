# LaunchPad MC
#### Control your game with a physical device!

This plugin allows you to use a [Novation LaunchPad](http://us.novationmusic.com/launch/launchpad-pro) MIDI control surface to control the [Elevators v2](http://dev.bukkit.org/projects/elevators-v2) plugin! Currently, only **LaunchPad Pro** is supported, but support for other MIDI controllers, as well as other aspects of the game, are planned.

This is mainly just an experiment, but if you're a plugin developer and you have something to add, or want to add support for another plugin, feel free to send me a pull-request on [GitHub](http://github.com/Pecacheu/LaunchPad-MC/pulls), or leave your suggestions on the [BukkitDev page](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/launchpad-mc)!
