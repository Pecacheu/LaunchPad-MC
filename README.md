# LaunchPad-MC

This is a plugin that allows you to use a [Novation LaunchPad](http://us.novationmusic.com/launch/launchpad-pro) MIDI control surface to control my [Elevators](http://dev.bukkit.org/projects/elevators-v2) plugin. Currently, it only allows you to use a LaunchPad Pro, but support for other MIDI controllers, as well as other aspects of the game, are planned.

### How To Use
Coming soon!
